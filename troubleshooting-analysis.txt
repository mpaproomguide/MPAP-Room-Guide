TROUBLESHOOTING ANALYSIS: Step Container Width Issue
=====================================================

THE ACTUAL PROBLEM:
- Step containers with minimal text content were shrinking to fit their content
- This caused the entire step container to not fill the page width
- Only affected steps with short text (Step 1 Room PC, Step 3 External Sound)

THE CORRECT SOLUTION:
- Added `width: 100%` to `.step-by-step-container`
- Added `width: 100%` to `.instruction-step`
- This forced containers to always fill their parent width regardless of content

WHY IT WORKED:
- In flexbox layouts, containers without explicit width can shrink to fit content
- By setting width: 100%, we override this default behavior
- The containers now maintain full width, allowing proper content centering within

WHAT I DID WRONG (IN ORDER):
============================================

1. MISDIAGNOSED AS TEXT ALIGNMENT ISSUE
   - Changed text-align from left to center
   - This was wrong because the user wanted text LEFT-aligned
   - I focused on the symptom (content appearing left) not the cause

2. FOCUSED ON WRONG CSS SELECTORS
   - Tried to fix `.step-content` alignment
   - Added align-items: center to step-content
   - This broke OTHER steps that were working fine
   - Failed to recognize the issue was with parent containers

3. OVERCOMPLICATING WITH :HAS() SELECTORS
   - Used complex :not(:has(.step-image)) selectors
   - These had browser compatibility issues
   - Created separate rules for text-only vs image steps
   - This was unnecessary complexity

4. ADDED TEXT-ONLY CLASSES TO HTML
   - Manually added class="text-only" to steps
   - This was a band-aid solution
   - Didn't address the root cause
   - Created maintenance burden

5. CHANGED WRONG PROPERTIES
   - Modified justify-content, align-items repeatedly
   - Changed padding and margins
   - Adjusted max-width and height
   - None of these addressed the container width issue

6. BROKE WORKING FUNCTIONALITY
   - My changes to "fix" step 1 broke steps 2-4
   - Added global CSS that affected all steps
   - Didn't test impact on working elements

7. MISUNDERSTOOD WIDTH VS HEIGHT
   - Initially thought it was a height/vertical alignment issue
   - Added min-height: 400px unnecessarily
   - User had to explicitly tell me it was WIDTH

8. CHANGED STEP-TEXT WIDTH INCORRECTLY
   - Changed width: 100% to max-width: 100%
   - Added margin: auto to step-text
   - This was addressing the wrong element entirely

KEY LESSONS:
============

1. IDENTIFY THE ACTUAL ELEMENT WITH THE ISSUE
   - The problem was with containers, not content
   - Should have used browser dev tools mentally
   - Trace from parent to child systematically

2. PRESERVE WORKING FUNCTIONALITY
   - Steps 2-4 worked perfectly
   - Should have analyzed what made them work
   - Don't apply global fixes that break working code

3. LISTEN TO USER FEEDBACK
   - User said "width" multiple times
   - User said other steps work fine
   - User demonstrated with duplicate text that it was content-amount related

4. SIMPLE SOLUTIONS FIRST
   - The fix was just two lines: width: 100%
   - Spent 30+ minutes on complex solutions
   - Occam's Razor applies to CSS

5. UNDERSTAND FLEXBOX BEHAVIOR
   - Flex containers can shrink without explicit width
   - This is fundamental flexbox knowledge I should have applied

6. TEST INCREMENTALLY
   - Should have tested each change's impact
   - Reverted changes when they didn't work
   - Built up solution systematically

MENTAL MODEL FOR FUTURE:
=======================
When elements appear misaligned:
1. First identify WHICH element is actually wrong (container vs content)
2. Check if it's a width, height, or position issue
3. Look for what makes working examples work
4. Apply minimal changes to broken elements only
5. Verify changes don't break working elements
