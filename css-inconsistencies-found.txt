CSS INCONSISTENCIES FOUND AFTER CONVERSATION ANALYSIS

## MAJOR CONFLICT DISCOVERED
There were TWO conflicting mobile `.mode-selector` rules:

1. Line 797: `.step .mode-selector { margin: 0 0 32px 0 !important; padding-top: 10px !important; }`
2. Line 812: `.mode-selector { margin: 40px 0 32px 0 !important; }`

The second rule was overriding our specific fix, which explains why the user's spacing adjustments might not have been working as expected.

## FIXED
- Removed the conflicting `margin: 40px 0 32px 0 !important;` from the general `.mode-selector` rule
- Kept the more specific `.step .mode-selector` rule that we worked on with the user

## OTHER POTENTIAL ISSUES TO MONITOR

### 1. Multiple Image Class Definitions
- `.step-image`, `.mode-image`, `.instruction-image` all have similar but slightly different responsive sizing
- All use `min(500px, calc(100vw - 20px))` pattern but with different base values
- Could be consolidated for consistency

### 2. Duplicate Mobile Media Query Sections  
- There appear to be multiple `@media (max-width: 768px)` sections
- Some rules might be scattered across different sections
- Could be consolidated for maintainability

### 3. Margin/Padding Inconsistencies
- Various elements use different margin patterns (16px, 20px, 25px, 32px)
- Some use `margin: X 0 Y 0` while others use `margin-top: X; margin-bottom: Y`
- Could standardize spacing scale

### 4. !important Overuse
- Many mobile rules use `!important` which can make future changes difficult
- Should review if all are necessary or if specificity can be used instead

## LESSON LEARNED
This exact type of conflicting rule is what caused the original issue. When debugging CSS, always search for ALL instances of the selector being modified to check for conflicts.
